\item{df}{Final GRC dataframe}

\item{gene}{The gene to analyze ("pfcrt", "pfdhps", "pfdhfr", "pfmdr1")}

\item{gene_col}{The column in the df that contains haplotype data (e.g., "PfCRT").}

\item{time}{Optional. A list defining time periods.}

\item{label_size}{Used to set the size of the labels on the map.}

\item{include_mixed}{Boolean, whether to include mixed haplotypes in counts}
}
\description{
This function calculates the frequency of wild, mutated, mixed, and missing haplotypes for a specified gene.
It also generates two tables: one for mutation types by position and another for mutations by location.
The function provides the option to include mixed haplotypes in the counts for both tables.
The first plot is a bar chart with the percentages of, wild, mutated, mixed and missing for the haplotype.
The second plots are maps which show these percentages in circles and the circle representing a location.
