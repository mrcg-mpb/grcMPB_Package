\title{Classify antimalarial drug resistance phenotypes and mutation patterns}
\usage{
pf_resistance_genotyper(df)
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{Combined GRC data frame}
}
\value{
A data frame with the input data plus new classification columns:
\itemize{
\item \strong{Chloroquine}: Resistance status based on PfCRT K76T mutation
("sensitive", "resistant", "mixed_resistant", "missing", or "undetermined")
\item \strong{Pyrimethamine}: Resistance status based on PfDHFR S108N mutation
("sensitive", "resistant", "mixed_resistant", "missing", or "undetermined")
\item \strong{Sulfadoxine}: Resistance status based on PfDHPS A437G mutation
("sensitive", "resistant", "mixed_resistant", "missing", or "undetermined")
\item \strong{Artemisinin}: Resistance status based on Kelch13 mutations
("sensitive", "resistant", "missing", or "undetermined")
\item \strong{SP_Mutations}: Classification of SP resistance pattern complexity,
ranging from "Wild" (no mutations) to "Octuple" (mutations at all key
positions). Includes mixed allele variants (e.g., "Triple.Mixed") and
alternative patterns (e.g., "Septuple_Alt").

\description{
This function analyzes genetic mutations in Plasmodium falciparum
to classify resistance patterns to multiple antimalarial drugs. It examines
specific genetic markers in PfCRT, PfDHFR, PfDHPS, and Kelch proteins to
determine resistance status for chloroquine, pyrimethamine, sulfadoxine,
and artemisinin. Additionally, it classifies samples based on the common
SP (sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine) resistance mutation patterns, ranging from
triple to octuple mutations.
